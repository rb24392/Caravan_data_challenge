The problem definition is to identify target customer for cross selling of its mobile home policies. I found the target dataset highly imbalanced , so I employed proper technique to tackle that. Also I have given importance to false negative rate as my error matrice along with accuracy as with high negative rate the company can loose potential customers. All these consideration in mind I found logistic regression as my best model for the task.
